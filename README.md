# README for DIP
Digital Image Processing with OpenCV/C++

1. Color transformation
- Convert color image to grayscale image
- Convert grayscale image to color image
- Convert images from RGB to HSV color systems
- Convert images from HSV color space to RGB color system
- Increase or decrease the brightness of the image
- Increase or decrease the contrast of the image
- Calculate histogram of color image, gray image
- Balance histogram color photo, gray photo
- Draw histogram of color image, gray image
- Photo comparison based on histogram

2. Geometric transformation
- Implement the AffineTransform class
- Implement the nearest neighbor interpolation class
- Implement the bilinear interpolation layer
- Implement the Transform function in the GeometricTransformer class
- Zoom in and out of images
- Resize the images
- Rotate images around the center (preserving images content)
- Rotate the image around the center (does not preserve the images content)
- Image symmetry across vertical (Oy) or horizontal (Ox) axis

3. Filter images on spatial domains
- The function calculates the convolution of two images
- Implement Filtering medium
- Implement Median filter
- Implement Smoothen the image with Gaussian
- Implement Edge detection with Sobel

- Implement Edge detection using Laplace

4. Edge detection using Canny
- Implement Edge detection with Canny

5. Image segmentation
- Static threshold classification
- Dynamic threshold classification by average
- Dynamic threshold Median
- Dynamic threshold classification Sauvola
- Segment by K-means

6. Compress images using SVD
- Compress images with SVD
- Decompression

7. Fourier transformation
- The forward Fourier transformation
- Inverse Fourier transformation
- Filter through frequency
